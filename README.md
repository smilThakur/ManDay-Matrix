Here's a clean and informative `README.md` for your **Deadline Calculator** project, now with a modern UI and persistent tracking:

# ⏳ Deadline Calculator

**Deadline Calculator** is a lightweight web tool that helps project managers estimate project completion dates based on total man-days, resource availability, and real-world working conditions (i.e., 22 working days per month). It also tracks changes in resources over time and updates the projected deadline accordingly.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ **Modern Neon UI** with blur and dark theme
- 📆 **Start date defaults to today**
- 👥 Calculates deadline based on **man-days and current resource count**
- 🔁 **Tracks history** of resource changes and updates the deadline accordingly
- 💾 **Persistent storage** using `localStorage`
- ♻️ **Reset button** to clear all data and start fresh
- 📅 Skips **Saturdays and Sundays**

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Enter total **man-days** and number of **resources**.
2. Select a **start date** (default is today).
3. Click **Calculate Deadline** to get the projected completion date.
4. If resource count changes mid-way, click **Change Resources** and enter the new count. The deadline will update automatically and log the change.
5. View history to see **commit-style logs** of resource usage.
6. Click **Reset Data** to clear all saved progress.
